These matrices can also be used in calculations performed in a smaller basis.
interaction.py automatically adjusts the matrix size in those cases.

Note: For M >= 7 the matrix elements here are neglected if they have a magnitude below 1e-3. This means you should expect an error on the order of Jmax*1e-3.
