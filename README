This alignment calculator has several entry points:

cos2_thermal.py
===============
Program for calculating alignment traces of a Boltzmann ensemble of symmetric tops in gas phase.

cos2_calc.py
============
Program for calculating alignment traces of a single |JKM> state of a symmetric top.

Note: Check the molecular data in conf/molecules.conf before blindly using them.
Always have a good source of information you can cite.

GUI.py
======
Graphical front-end for both cos2_thermal.py and cos2_calc.py.
Requires PyQt5.

precalculate_matrix_elements.py 
===============================
Script for calculating <J'KM| cos^2 theta_2d |JKM> matrix elements in advance.
If you run this script, the matrix elements will not have to be calculated
every time you calculate a 2d alignment trace.

This saves some time if e.g. you calculate several similar alignment traces
or you write something like an optimisation script up against this program.
