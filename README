cos2_thermal.py
===============
Program for calculating alignment traces of a Boltzmann ensemble of symmetric tops in gas phase.

cos2_calc.py
============
Program for calculating alignment traces of a single |JKM> state of a symmetric top.

Note: Check the molecular data in conf/molecules.conf before blindly using them.
Always have a good source of information you can cite.


GUI.py
======
Graphical front-end for both cos2_thermal.py and cos2_calc.py.
Requires PyQt5.


FOR CALCULATING cos^2 theta 2D
==============================
Some cos^2 theta 2d matrix elements have been pre-computed.
If you want to use these, copy them into the precomputed_U2d_matrices folder. 

To calculate them yourself, use the U2d.py program. Presently, you will need
some knowledge of C to modify
