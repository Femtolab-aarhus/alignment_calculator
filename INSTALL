The alignment calculator is written mostly in Python, and depends 
on numpy, matplotlib, scipy and PyQt5.
A python installation with these dependencies should be enough to get started.
See README for an overview on how to use the program.


Two helper libraries, written in C and FORTRAN, are available too.

libpropagation is a library for quickly propagating the wave function
and evaluating expectation values. With this library,
alignment trace calculation is significantly faster than with only 
a Python installation.

libU2d is a library for calculating 2d matrix elements. In order to calculate
2d alignment traces, this library is required, unless precomputed matrix
elements are available.

To compile these libraries, just enter "make".
You will need a C and FORTRAN compiler. The makefile is set up to
use gcc and gfortran. As a recommended option, you should
also have the GNU Scientific Library, GSL installed.
This library is used to speed up calculation of 2d matrix elements.
Without it, you must pass the -DNO_GSL switch to gcc and
remove the -lgsl -lgslcblas flags.
This is the default on Windows.
