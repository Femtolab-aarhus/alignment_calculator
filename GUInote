designer GUI.ui
pyuic5 GUI.ui > _gui.py

Roadblock for perfect windows support:

     o locking files implemented with lockf
       -> Could be solved by moving logic out of interaction.py
          and into dispatcher ?
     o U2d.c using mmap 
       -> make U2d a shared library?
     o U2d using gnu scientific library -> needs compile once solution 
       -> licensing issues (avoided if we only use the dll internally)
